<h1>Getting started </h1>
<p><span class="content">The TOOLBOX DE is an Eclipse plugin, wirtten in Java, that extends some already existing functionality of the IDE itself and some other exported by the WTP plugin which can be used to write a valid TOOLBOX service to deploy into the TOOLBOX RE. It provides built-in features like graphical vs textual visualization, tag suggestion, online validation.</span></p>
<p><span class="content">A common development path, using the TOOLBOX DE, follows these few points:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="content">Creation of a service project.</span></li>
  <li><span class="content">Creation of service operation.</span></li>
  <li><span class="content">Creation and setup of all resources and files needed for running the operation.</span></li>
  <li><span class="content">Editing of the TOOLBOX scripts (implementing operations' logic), helped by all assistance features (like online validation, error markup etc).</span></li>
  <li>Deploy of the service to the TOOLBOX RE. </li>
  <li><span class="content">Execution/Debug of one of the service's operations.</span></li>
  <li><span class="content">Visualization and inspection of the execution output.</span></li>
</ul>

   <p align="justify"><strong><img src="images/warning.gif" width="28" height="21"> The Toolbox documentation is provided via the eclipse infocenter or via the Eclipse Help. </strong><strong>If the Toolbox RE has been installed, the infocenter is an additional server which runs on port 7001. Thus port 7001 has to be accessible from outside your network.  However, in unsecure environment like Internet, it is recommended infocenter is not accessed directly by clients, but is made available through an HTTP server or an application server. Most servers come with modules or servlets for delegating certain request to other web resources. For example, one may configure a proxy module of Apache HTTP Server to redirect requests made to http://mycompany.com/help to http://internalserver:7001/help that runs an infocenter. Please read the <a href="../RE/apache.html">Apache installation</a> section for more information. If the Toolbox DE has been successfully installed, the documentation can be accessed clicking F1 and then selecting &quot;All Topics&quot;. A new entry named &quot;TOOLBOX User Manual&quot; is added to the documentation installed under Eclipse. </strong></p>
