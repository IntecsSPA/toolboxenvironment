<h1>System requirements</h1>
<p>The TOOLBOX can be installed using different configurations. Apache
can be used as a proxy server and Tomcat as a servlet engine.
Alternatively the TOOLBOX can be installed using only Tomcat.
Furthermore Apache and Tomcat can be installed on the same machine or
on two different machines.</p>
<p>Thus the system requirements depend on the TOOLBOX components
configuration. In the following a list of the system requirements for
each component both for a Windows and a Linux machine is reported. The
TOOLBOX system requirement can be calculated depending on the
configuration used.</p>
<h5>Windows machine system requirements</h5>
<!--p>The TOOLBOX can be run on different versions of Tomcat. The following configurations have been tested:</p-->
<ol>
  <li>J2SE Development Kit 5.0 (JDK 5.0) + Tomcat 5.5.9</li>
  <div>
  <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="920">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row" bgcolor="#000000" width="188"><span class="Stile1"> J2SE Development Kit 5.0 (JDK 5.0) </span></th>
        <td bgcolor="#cccccc" width="718">
        <p>J2SE
Development Kit 5.0 (JDK 5.0) is supported on Microsoft Windows running
Intel IA32, 100% compatible processors, and AMD Opteron 32. For
supported versions of Windows, along with disk and RAM requirements,
see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html" target="_blank">System Configurations.</a></p>
        <p><strong> Amount of disk space required. </strong>It
depends on the installation options. In case the typical installation
has been chosen 281 MB are required. For further details please see the
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/install-windows-diskspace.html" target="_blank">java 1.5 Windows Disk Space Requirements.</a></p>
        <p> Note - The JDK has two version numbers -- external version
number 5.0 and internal version number 1.5.0. </p>
        <p>Note
- Trying to install the JDK on a non-supported version of Microsoft
Windows or on a machine that doesn't have a sufficiently up-to-date
Service Pack will cause the installer to generate this warning: "We
recommend that you do not install this Java platform for the following
reasons: This Java platform does not support the operating system or
operating-system service pack on this machine." </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apache: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The
primary Windows platform for running Apache 2.0 is Windows NT. The
binary installer only works with the x86 family of processors, such as
Intel and AMD processors. Running Apache on Windows 9x is not
thoroughly tested, and it is never recommended on production systems.</li>
  <li>On
all operating systems, TCP/IP networking must be installed and working.
If running on Windows 95, the Winsock 2 upgrade must be installed. On
Windows NT 4.0, installing Service Pack 6 is strongly recommended, as
Service Pack 4 created known issues with TCP/IP and Winsock integrity
that were resolved in later Service Packs. For further details please
see <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/platform/windows.html" target="_blank">Using Apache with Microsoft Windows.</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Linux machine system requirements</h5>

<p>Apache: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Disk
Space - Make sure you have at least 50 MB of temporary free disk space
available. After installation Apache occupies approximately 10 MB of
disk space. The actual disk space requirements will vary considerably
based on your chosen configuration options and any third-party modules.</li>
  <li>ANSI-C Compiler and Build System - Make sure you have an ANSI-C
compiler installed. The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html" target="_blank">GNU C
compiler (GCC)</a> from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>
is recommended (version 2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at
least make sure your vendor's compiler is ANSI compliant. In addition,
your PATH must contain basic build tools such as make.</li>

In
the case a local instance of the EOP catalogue is required, PostgreSQL
8.3 and PostGis 1.3 must be installed and configured on the machine.
Once done multiple
database instances can be created following the procedure described <a href="createebRRDBinstance.html">here</a>.<br>
In case one or more Toolbox services must be protected enforcing
security, an additional Java library shall de downloaded and installed.
