        <h3>Toolbox Archiving Service</h3>
        The service can be created using the Toolbox administration web interface. A wizard like procedure takes
        the user to a complete deployment of the service.
        Follow these steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Access the Toolbox Administration Web console by providing administrator credentials.
                The console is usually accessible via the URL http://&lt;IP&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;/TOOLBOX</li>
            <li>Click on "Service Management"</li>
            <li>Click on "Create a new Service"</li>
            <li>Open the "Create an Archiving service" panel</li>
            <li>Provide a service name for the service</li>
            <li>Select "OGC-05-007r7 version 1.0.0" interface type</li>
            <li>Select "Standalone" as interface mode</li>
            <li>Click on "Create Archiving Service"</li>
        </ul>

        This will create the service and you will be redirected to the configuration page. You have now to modify the service configuration.
        Follow the below steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Move to the end of the page and update the field in the "Configure service variables"</li>
            <li>Click on the "Configure" button</li>
            <li>The page is refreshed and a list of operation is shown</li>
            <li>Select all operations and click on "Create"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ARMS Servlet</h3>
        The ARMS Servlet can be simply deployed on an host by copying its war file under the <APACHE_HOME>/webapps folder.
        Tomcat will automatically deploy the application. Once deployed, the ARMS Servlet needs to be configured. Please refer to the configuration section for further details.
