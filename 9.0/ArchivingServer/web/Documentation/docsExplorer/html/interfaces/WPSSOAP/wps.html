        <h2>WPS operation</h2>
        The Toolbox Archiving Service implements a standard WPS interface with SOAP bindings. Thus all WPS operation are exposed by the service and can be invoked following the methodologies described in the standard document.
        The service implements the GetCapabilities and DescribeProcessing operation plus an Execute operation for each processing.
        The full table of the operations implemented by the service is given below with a description and the SOAP Action.
        All operations can be invoked through a SOAP 1.1 exchange and are synchronous.
