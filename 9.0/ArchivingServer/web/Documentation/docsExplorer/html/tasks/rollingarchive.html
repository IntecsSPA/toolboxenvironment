        <h2>Setup a rolling archive</h2>
        The ARMS has been developed with the rolling archive feature in mind. Through this, the ARMS is capable of automatically delete
        data and metadata after a configurable amount of time. Setting up a rolling archive is simple and requires only a proper configuration of
        the Archiving Servlet.
        To enable the rolling archive the administrator has to set the proper value for the configuration parameter <span class="Stile1">Delete After</span> in the main configuration page (see here). This parameter sets the time interval after which data shall be automatically deleted. When this field is set, the ARMS acts as a rolling archive, deleting automatically all stored data after the specified amount of time (and managing accordingly the corresponding metadata). Data and metadata can still be deleted via the delete operation.
