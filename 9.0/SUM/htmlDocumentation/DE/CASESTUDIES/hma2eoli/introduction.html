<h1>Introduction
</h1>
<p>HMA2EOLI is a Toolbox service finalized to the integration of the EOLI interface with the HMA portal. The HMA project leads to the integration of several heterogeneous mission systems in order to obtain a multimission catalogue service. </p>
<p>Two interfaces are implemented in the service: the first (getRecords) is used to query the catalogue for records matching some user-defined criteria while the second (getRecordById) is used to obtain the record specifying it through its id. The last one is usually used after a getRecords call.</p>
<p>One script for each interface has been written and a common path has been followed for its logic: </p>
<ul>
  <li>at a first time all needed informations are extracted from the request coming from the HMA portal </li>
  <li>extracted values are used for calling the correspondent EOLI interface</li>
  <li>EOLI response is parsed and return values extracted</li>
  <li>HMA response is built using values extracted from EOLI response</li>
</ul>
