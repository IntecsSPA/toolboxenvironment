<h1>Import of a service through an XML descriptor </h1>
<p>Starting from TOOLBOX RE 7.0, a service can be exported and imported using a zip package as a descriptor. The old XML service descriptor cannot be used to import  services. In order to not rebuild them from scratch a wizard has been added to the TOOLBOX DE to provide a convertion between the two descriptors.</p>
<p>To open the import wizard select &quot;Import&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu. Select &quot;TOOLBOX/Service (from a Service Descriptor)&quot; item and click &quot;Next&quot;. </p>
