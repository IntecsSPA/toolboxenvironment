<h1>Buddata ebXML Registry (ebRR)</h1>
<p align="justify">Buddata ebXML Registry/Repository (or ebRR in short) is an open source implementation of the OASIS ebXML Registry and OGC Catalogue Service. Much experience has been drawn from the OMAR ebXML Registry open source project (also known as "freebXML"). Extensions of the OASIS ebXML Registry have been implemented to support geospatial capabilities.</p>
<p align="justify">The project is initiated by kZen Labs - the R&D division of Foresee technologies N.V., a Belgian IT company - and funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) in support of the cataloguing activity for the Heterogeneous Mission Accessibility - Interoperability program (HMA-I) via the ESA ERGO project.</p>
<p align="justify">Buddata ebRR put's a strong focus on its geospatial capabilities and the goal of the project is to include all so-called "ebRIM Profiles" or "extension packages" as defined by the OGC Catalogue Service, but also to support any other ebRIM profiles.</p>
<p align="justify">Natively it implements (Secured) SOAP Web Service interfaces based on the OASIS ebXML RS 3.0 and OGC Catalogue Service specifications. Its main other features are (1) a harvesting component with transformation capabilities to translate XML-based metadata in GML and ISO formats to ebXML RIM (with OGC geospatial extensions) and (2) a Java API to access the ebRR directly from Java code.</p>

<h1>SSE Toolbox catalogue integration</h1>
<p align="justify">The Toolbox has been upgraded in order to natively support new OGC Catalogue Interfaces.  The following ebRIM profiles will be supported by the tool over the OGC CSW 2.0.2 interface:
<ul>
    <li> OGC-06-131r4  OGC Catalogue Services Specification 2.0 Extension Package for ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) Application Profile</li>
    <li> OGC-07-038     OGC Cataloguing of ISO Metadata (CIM) Using the ebRIM profile of CS-W</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p align="justify">It will be possible to instantiate the new Catalogue Service following two different approaches: gateway and stand-alone.
</p>

<p align="justify">The former will allow the user to link an existing catalogue providing the Toolbox Catalogue Service logic in the form of XML scripting. In this case the development approach is similar to developing a Toolbox service.
</p>

<p align="justify">The latter approach will provide the functionalities to create a local Catalogue Service without the need of an already existing catalogue and without the need of providing any form of logic.</p>

<p align="justify">Buddata ebXML Registry has been selected to add these functionalities to the Toolbox.
