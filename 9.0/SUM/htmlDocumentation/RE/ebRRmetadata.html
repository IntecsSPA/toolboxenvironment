<h1>Harvesting metadata</h1>
<p>The database of a catalogue service can be populated either via its
Harvest SOAP operation (if implemented) or through a web page placed
under the Tools section.</p>
<p>In order to complete this task, click on the "Harvest" icon in the
"Tools" section and fill the form, when displayed. It is possible to
set both URL and object type for the data harvested. The object type is
automatically filled with a default value.</p>
<p>When the form has been filled, click on the "Harvest" icon to trigger the execution of the operation.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the harvest operation refers to the services
selected and that the SOAP Harvest operation must be implemented.
Otherwise an error is raised.</p>
