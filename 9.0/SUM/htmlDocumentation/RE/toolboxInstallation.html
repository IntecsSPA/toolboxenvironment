                    <h1>Installing the TOOLBOX</h1>
    <p>Before installing the TOOLBOX you have to install the following 
                      component: <a href="jdk.html">JDK</a> 
                      and optionally <a href="apache.html">Apache</a>.</p>
                    <p>The TOOLBOX can be easily installed using a graphical installer. The installer is Java based and can be run on any operating system where a Java virtual machine is available. Depending on the operating system, it can be launched by a double-click or a simple <em>java -jar installer.jar</em> from a shell.  The main benefit of the installer is that it provides a clean and unique way of installing the TOOLBOX on operating systems. The installer is reported to run on: </p>
  <ul>
                      <li>Unix-like systems, mostly Linux and FreeBSD variants
                      <li>Windows XP, Vista.                       
  </ul>
                    <p>Moreover for each operating system the installer is provided in two versions:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Full installer: it includes all the software needed to install the TOOLBOX in the jar file.
                      <li>light installer: it includes only the installer. The resources needed to install the TOOLBOX (TOMCAT and the TOOLBOX jar file) are downloaded at installation time.
                    </ul>
                    <p>In both cases the installer allows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="toolboxInstallationTomcat.html">installing the TOOLBOX on a TOMCAT server already installed</a> on the target machine (a check of the TOMCAT version is done at installation time)                       
                      <li><a href="toolboxInstallationNew.html">installing the TOOLBOX on the TOMCAT</a> server included in the installation pack.
                        </p>
    </ul>
                    <p>Moreover the installer allows <a href="toolboxUpgrade.html">upgrading an already installed TOOLBOX</a> to the new version. </p>
