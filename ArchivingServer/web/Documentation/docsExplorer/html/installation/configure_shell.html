        <h2>Configuration of metadata extraction shell scripts</h2>
The ARMS can be configured in order to be capable of extracting
metadata from downloaded data. The solution provided by the ARMS will
allow the administrator to associate a shell script file to a data
type. Each time a data is downloaded and the client hasn't specified a
metadata document, the shell script is executed. If metadata is
produced successfully it is harvested into the ebRIM catalogue
specified in the store operation input message (see <a href="../tasks/store.html">here</a> for a description).In order to add a shell script, the administrator has to execute the following steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Copy the shell script under &lt;APACHE_TOMCAT&gt;/webapps/ArchivingServer/WEB-INF/metadataExtractors</li>
            <li>Open the file&nbsp;&lt;APACHE_TOMCAT&gt;/webapps/ArchivingServer/WEB-INF/classes/metadataExtractionProcessings.properties<br></li>
            <li>Edit
the file. Find the key matching the data type and put the file name of
the shell script as value. If the key is not available, add a new one</li>
            <li>Save the properties file</li>
        </ul>
The system will automatically fetch the change without need of
reloading the application or Tomcat. The ARMS servlet will identify the
data type through the DataType field available in the input message.
Depending on the interface used, the DataType field may differ. Please
refer to the section <a href="../interfaces/main.html">Interfaces</a> for a detailed description.
