<p align="left">Select &quot;Toolbox/Service/Operation&quot; and click &quot;Next&quot;. A new wizard page is shown, allowing you to change the service to operate on (in case you have erroneously selected the wrong service) selecting it. Now click on &quot;Next&quot;. </p>

<p align="left">If, when creating the service, an interface has been selected form the Interface Repository, the wizard will let you choose one or more of those operations associated to the interface and not already implemented. </p>
<p align="left">As shown below, in order to add them you have to select them and click on &quot;Finish&quot;.</p>
<p align="center"> <img src="../images/new-operation_003.png" width="500" height="530"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="../images/new-operation_004.png" width="500" height="530"> </p>
