                <p>
                    Apache 2.0's configuration and installation environment has changed completely from Apache 1.3. Apache 1.3 used a custom set of scripts to achieve easy installation. Apache 2.0 now uses libtool and autoconf to create an environment that looks like many other Open Source projects.
                </p>
                <h2>System requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    The following requirements exist for building Apache:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disk Space: make sure you have at least 50 MB of temporary free disk space available. After installation Apache occupies approximately 10 MB of disk space. The actual disk space requirements will vary considerably based on your chosen configuration options and any third-party modules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ANSI-C Compiler and Build System: make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler (GCC) (available at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version 2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your vendor's compiler is ANSI compliant. In addition, your PATH must contain basic build tools such as make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accurate time keeping: elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as the time of day. So, it's time to investigate setting some time synchronization facility on your system. Usually the ntpdate or xntpd programs are used for this purpose that are based on the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
                </p>
                <h2>Compiling and Installing Apache</h2>
                <p>
                    The following steps are required in order to install Apache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Source extraction
                </p>
                <p>
                    Download the source file and type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ gzip -d httpd-2_0_43.tar.gz
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ tar xvf httpd-2_0_43.tar
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will create a new directory (httpd-2_0_43) under the current directory containing the source code for the distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Source tree configuration
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supposing to be placed in the directory where the source files have been uncompressed and decompressed type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ cd httpd-2_0_43
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX] --enable-proxy
                </p>
                <p>
                    The option --prefix specifies the directory under which the Apache files will be installed (Default: /usr/local/apache2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The option --enable-proxy is for compiling and including the module proxy_module making Apache act as a proxy server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Building
                </p>
                <p>
                    Type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ make
                </p>
                <p>
                    A base configuration takes approximately 3 minutes to compile under a Pentium III/Linux 2.2 system, but this will vary widely depending on your hardware and the number of modules that you have enabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Installation
                </p>
                <p>
                    Install the package under the configured installation PREFIX (see --prefix option above) by running:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ make install
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are upgrading, the installation will not overwrite your configuration files or documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5) Customization
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, you can customize your Apache HTTP server by editing the configuration files under PREFIX/conf/. The main configuration file is httpd.conf. Changes to the main configuration files are only recognized by Apache when it is started or restarted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have a look at the Apache manual under docs/manual/ or <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/" target="_blank">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/</a>
                    for a complete reference of available configuration directives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6) Testing
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can start your Apache HTTP server by immediately running:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you should be able to request your first document via URL http://localhost/. The web page you see is located under the DocumentRoot which will usually be PREFIX/htdocs/.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, stop the server again by running:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop
                </p>
                <h2>Starting Apache</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to start Apache the httpd program must be invoked. This program runs as a daemon and executes continuously in the background to handle requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The httpd program can be invoked in two ways (described below, supposing you have installed Apache under the default directory, /usr/local/apache2), directly or by the apachectl script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) To start Apache by directly invoking the httpd daemon, type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd
                </p>
                <p>
                    (The first thing that httpd does when it is invoked is to locate and read the configuration file httpd.conf. The location of this file is set at compile-time, but it is possible to specify its location at run time using the -f command-line option as in: /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -f /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf)
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) To start Apache by the apachectl script type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, if all goes well during start-up, the server will detach from the terminal and the command prompt will return almost immediately. This indicates that the server is up and running. You can then use your browser to connect to the server and view the test page in the DocumentRoot directory and the local copy of the documentation linked from that page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Apache suffers a fatal problem during startup, it will write a message describing the problem either to the console or to the ErrorLog before exiting. One of the most common error messages is &quot;Unable to bind to Port ...&quot;. This message is usually caused by either:
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="content">
                    <div style="border: 2px none ; margin-left: 0pt;">
                        Trying to start the server on a privileged port when not logged in as the root user; or
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="content">
                    <div style="border: 2px none ; margin-left: 0pt;">
                        Trying to start the server when there is another instance of Apache or some other web server already bound to the same Port.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="content">
            <div style="border: 2px none ; margin-left: 0pt;">
                <p>
                    If you want your server to continue running after a system reboot, you should add a call to httpd or apachectl to your system startup files (typically rc.local or a file in an rc.N directory). This will start Apache as root. Before doing this ensure that your server is properly configured for security and access restrictions. The apachectl script is designed so that it can often be linked directly as an init script, but be sure to check the exact requirements of your system.
                </p>
                <h2>Stopping and restarting Apache</h2>
                <p>
                    To stop and restart Apache signals must be sent to the httpd daemon. You will notice many httpd executables running on your system, but you should not send signals to any of them except the parent, whose pid is in the PidFile. That is to say you shouldn't ever need to send signals to any process except the parent. Signals can be sent to the httpd daemon in two ways (described below), directly or by the apachectl script-
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) To stop and restart Apache by directly invoking the httpd daemon, type:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ kill -Signal `cat /usr/local/apache2/logs/httpd.pid`
                </p>
                <p>
                    where Signal can hold one of the following values:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Signal = TERM (STOP NOW)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sending the TERM signal to the parent causes it to immediately attempt to kill off all of its children. It may take it several seconds to complete killing off its children. Then the parent itself exits. Any requests in progress are terminated, and no further requests are served.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Signal = USR1 (GRACEFUL RESTART)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The USR1 signal causes the parent process to advise the children to exit after their current request (or to exit immediately if they're not serving anything). The parent re-reads its configuration files and re-opens its log files. As each child dies off the parent replaces it with a child from the new generation of the configuration, which begins serving new requests immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On certain platforms that do not allow USR1 to be used for a graceful restart, an alternative signal may be used (such as WINCH).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Signal = HUP (RESTART NOW)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sending the HUP signal to the parent causes it to kill off its children like in TERM but the parent doesn't exit. It re-reads its configuration files, and re-opens any log files. Then it spawns a new set of children and continues serving hits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) To stop and restart Apache by the apachectl script, type one of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ apachectl stop (STOP NOW)
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ apachectl graceful (GRACEFUL RESTART)
                </p>
                <p>
                    $ apachectl restart (RESTART NOW)
                </p>
                <h2>Linking Apache and Tomcat</h2>
                <p>
                    Apache supports an optional module (mod_proxy) that configures the web server to act as a proxy server. This can be used to forward requests for a particular web application to a Tomcat instance, without having to configure a web connector such as mod_webapp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to link Apache and Tomcat some directives have to be added in the Apache httpd.conf configuration file. To accomplish this, you need to perform the following tasks:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Open the Apache httpd.conf configuration file with any editor
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Include the following two directives in your httpd.conf file to forward the Web application of the TOOLBOX to Tomcat at context path /TOOLBOX:
                </p>
                <p>
                    ProxyPass /TOOLBOX http://Tomcat_host:8080/TOOLBOX
                </p>
                <p>
                    ProxyPassReverse /TOOLBOX http://Tomcat_host:8080/TOOLBOX
                </p>
                <p>
                    which tell Apache to forward URLs of the form http:// Apache_Host/TOOLBOX/* to the Tomcat connector listening on port 8080.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to make the changes effective restart Apache.
                </p>
