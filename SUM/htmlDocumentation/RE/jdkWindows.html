                <h2>System requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    See supported <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/system-configurations-135212.html">System Configurations </a> for information about supported platforms, operating systems, desktop managers, and browsers. </p>
                <p>The minimum physical RAM is required to run graphically based applications. More RAM is recommended for applets running within a browser using the Java Plugin. Running with less memory may cause disk swapping which has a severe effect on performance. Very large programs may require more RAM for adequate performance. </p>
                <p>This installation requires Windows Installer 2.0 to be on your machine. For more details, see the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/install-windows-189425.html#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting the Installation </a> section . </p>
                <p>For the amount of disk space required, see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/windows-diskspace-140460.html">Windows Disk Space Requirements </a>. </p>
                Note - The JDK has two version numbers -- external version number (6) and an internal version number (1.6.0).
                <p>Note - Trying to install the JDK on a non-supported version of Microsoft Windows or on a machine that doesn't have a sufficiently up-to-date Service Pack will cause the installer to generate this warning: "We recommend that you do not install this Java platform for the following reasons: This Java platform does not support the operating system or operating-system service pack on this machine." See the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/install-windows-189425.html#requirements">system requirements </a> above for information on supported configurations of Microsoft Windows. </p>
                <p>Detailed information regarding the system requirements and instructions on how to install the JDK 1.6.0 can be found on the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/install-142943.html">Java Platform Installation page</a> </p>
