about.description=TOOBOX is a suite of applications whose aim is to allow users to easily develop Web Services. The suite is compsed by a Runtime Engine (TOOLBOX RE) and an Eclipse based IDE (TOOLBOX DE).<br>The aim of the whole project is to provide a simple architecture for developing Web Services by creating simple scripting files. The scripting files will provide the internal logic of Web Services.
