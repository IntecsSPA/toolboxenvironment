        <h2>Overview</h2>
        The Archiving and Resource Management Services (ARMS) is a service which aims to automate some common tasks
        performed on Earth Observation data and metadata. The ARMS is capable of:
        <ul>
            <li>Asynchronously download data and metadata from an HTTP or FTP host</li>
            <li>Extract metadata from data through a shell script based mechanism</li>
            <li>Publish metadata on an CSW ebRIM catalogue</li>
            <li>Publish vector data or coverage data on a Geoserver instance</li>
            <li>Publish data via HTTP and FTP</li>
            <li>Delete data and metadata from all hosts where it is published to</li>
        </ul>
        The functionalities of the ARMS address both the short-term and long-term archiving of the
            input data.
        <ul>
            <li>The short-term (temporary) archiving is aimed at storing the results of intermediate
                processing steps in a chain of services (as in the Workflow Orchestration Service)</li>
            <li>The long-term archiving is aimed at permanently storing the final results of a computation
                or the data submitted by a Data Provider</li>
        </ul>

        The ARMS is composed by two components: the TOOLBOX Archiving Service and the ARMS Servlet.<br>

        <h2>Toolbox Archiving Service</h2>
        The Toolbox Archiving Service is a service to be run in a TOOLBOX instance and provides to the
        user a WPS SOAP interface. This service will receive all WPS requests from clients and properly invokes
        the Archiving Servlet. Using a TOOLBOX service to provide a WPS SOAP interface is more powerful than directly
        providing such interface in the Archiving Servlet since it is possible to use all functionalities provided by
        TOOLBOX. Examples are: securing the service, providing multiple endpoints for the same ARMS servlet, start/stop/suspend
        of the client interaction with the service without affecting the engine work.

        <h2>ARMS Servlet</h2>
        <p>The ARMS servlet is a Java servlet which provides the core logic to the ARMS. It is responsible to perform
        all tasks assigned to the ARMS and to provide access to data when made accessible via HTTP and FTP. The servlet exposes
        a REST interface which is used by the Toolbox Archiving Service. No checks are done on the client request
        so the servlet can be used without the Toolbox Service. Obviously in this case no WPS interface is exposed.
