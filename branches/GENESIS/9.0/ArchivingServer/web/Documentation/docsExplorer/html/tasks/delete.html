        <h2>Delete data and metadata</h2>
        Data and metadata may be explicitly deleted from the ARMS by invoking the delete operation. This operation removes all links in the internal database and
        takes care of deleting data from all services where it is deployed. If data has associated metadata, these will be removed from the catalogue where it has been
         harvested.
         This operation is synchronous and return after the deletion task has been completed.
