<h1>XML 
                        Script Tags reference</h1> 
                      <p>The TOOLBOX can be configured by means of an XML scripting 
                        language. The TOOLBOX supports two XML scripting languages: 
                        one is a language whose interpreter comes with the TOOLBOX 
                        libraries and the other is the Jelly XML scripting language.<br>
                        Both the Jelly and the TOOLBOX XML scripting language 
                        provide a set of TAGs that allows describing the operation 
                        needed to implement the service on the backside.<br>
                        The description of the Jelly XML scripting language is 
                        out of the scope of this document: for more details about 
                        this concern please see the documentation available on 
                        the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/" target="_blank">Jelly 
                        Web Site</a>.<br>
                        The TOOLBOX Engine is a set of Java classes that actually 
                        execute the instructions contained in the XML service 
                        scripting files. The used XML language is de-facto a programming 
                        language, validated by a schema and executed by the Engine 
                        in a similar manner as the JVM does with Java classes.</p>
                      <p>The XML TAGs can be logically grouped as follows:
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> 
                        <div align="justify">The core group is based on the Java 
                          Reflection and allows creation of new Java Objects and 
                          primitive types, as well as the method invocation on 
                          the Java objects. This group could be enough to define 
                          virtually any complex behavior but imply a good knowledge 
                          of Java language and libraries. Moreover, XML scripts 
                          using just this sets of TAGs, although very powerful, 
                          tend to be quite verbose and difficult to read and maintain. 
                          A good use of these TAGs is to integrate existing Java 
                          API. If some Java classes are available to implement 
                          the complex logic of the service, the XML script will 
                          be used just to link them to the TOOLBOX logic, leading 
                          to very simple and efficient XML scripts.</div>
                      </li>
                      <li> 
                        <div align="justify">The assignment group contains two 
                          tags allowing storing variables.</div>
                      </li>
                      <li> 
                        <div align="justify">The control flow group contains tags 
                          allowing conditionally or repeatedly executing an excerpt 
                          of script and tags changing the normal, sequential flow 
                          of control. Thus, this group includes tag “simulating” 
                          the “if”, “while”, “for” statements of any programming 
                          language as well as the “try and catch” statement of 
                          the Java language. This last tag is for handling errors 
                          occurred during the script execution.</div>

                          to perform conditional operations on tags returning

                          in variables that can be recalled at any time without 
                          repeating XML chunks and without loading overhead.</div>
