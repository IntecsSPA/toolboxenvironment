<p align="left">If the service to which the operation shall be added doesn't implement any of the interfaces of the Interface Repository the following page is shown:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/createOperationWithoutInterfaceStep1.png" width="251" height="122"> </p>
<p align="left">Here the user is requested to select if the new operation shall be of type synchronous or asynchronous. Once this choice has been done and the &quot;Next&quot; button has been clicked the user is asked to enter scripts that implements the operation logic. The number of scripts requested depends by the type of the operation. A description of the number and type of the scripts can be found in the <a href="../overview.html">overview.</a></p>
<p align="left">The next image gives an example in case of asynchronous operations.</p>

<p align="left">Together with scripts, the user shall provide a name for the operation before finalizing the creation of the operation by clicking on &quot;Create&quot;. </p>
