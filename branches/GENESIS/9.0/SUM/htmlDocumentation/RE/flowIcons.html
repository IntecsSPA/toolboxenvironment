            <p align="justify">
                In the following a description of the flow icons and their meaning for synchronous and asynchronous instances is reported.

            <p align="justify">
                <img src="images/email-icon.jpg" width="18" height="18"/>This icon is displayed only if the error email report is activated. By clicking on this icon it is possible to display a copy of the error report email sent to the SSE or to the other recipients defined in the TOOLBOX configuration procedure.

                <img src="images/garrow.waiting.jpg" width="19" height="33"/>This icon is displayed only when a request is in waiting status: the SOAP message has been received but the 
                the TOOLBOX has not yet  
                executed the First script corresponding to the request. 
                This can happen in the following two cases: the queuing  
                mechanism is on and the request has not been scheduled 
                yet; the service is suspended in SOFT mode;
