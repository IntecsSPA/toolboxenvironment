                <h1>Starting the TOOLBOX</h1>
                <p>
                    The starting procedure depends on the TOOLBOX components 
                    configuration. The TOOLBOX can be installed using Apache  
                    as a proxy and Tomcat as a servlet engine. Alternatively 
                    the TOOLBOX can be installed using only Tomcat. Furthermore  
                    Apache and Tomcat can be installed on the same machine or 
                    on two different machines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus some of the steps below can be skipped depending on 
                    the TOOLBOX physical configuration.
                </p>
                <h2>Running Apache on a Windows machine</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong><img src="images/note.gif" width="17" height="17">This step has to be performed only if the Apache Server 
                        has been used as a proxy server.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apache is assumed installed as a service, this means that after the installation 
                    Apache is running in the background and will start automatically 
                    when the machine boots. However, in case Apache is not running as a service, to run Apache from the command line as a console application, use the following command:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>apache </em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Apache will execute, and will remain running until it is stopped by pressing Control-C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also run Apache via the shortcut Start Apache in Console placed to Start Menu --&gt; Programs --&gt; Apache HTTP Server 2.0.xx --&gt; Control Apache Server during the installation. This will open a console window and start Apache inside it. If you don't have Apache installed as a service, the window will remain visible until you stop Apache by pressing Control-C in the console window where Apache is running in. The server will exit in a few seconds. However, if you do have Apache installed as a service, the shortcut starts the service. If the Apache service is running already, the shortcut doesn't do anything. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After starting Apache (either in a console window or as a service) it will be listening on port 80 (unless you changed the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mpm_common.html#listen">Listen </a>
                    directive in the configuration files or installed Apache only for the current user). To connect to the server and access the default page, launch a browser and enter this URL: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    http://localhost/
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apache should respond with a welcome page and a link to the Apache manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in the error.log file in the logs subdirectory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mpm_common.html#listen" target="_blank">Listen </a>
                    specified in the configuration file is default of 80 (or any other port below 1024), then it is necessary to have root privileges in order to start apache, so that it can bind to this privileged port. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the server has started and performed a few preliminary activities such as opening its log files, it will launch several child processes which do the work of listening for and answering requests from clients. The main httpd process continues to run as the root user, but the child processes run as a less privileged user. This is controlled by the selected <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mpm.html" target="_blank">Multi-Processing Module </a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommended method of invoking the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>
                    executable is to use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    control script. This script sets certain environment variables that are necessary for <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>
                    to function correctly under some operating systems, and then invokes the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>
                    binary. <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    will pass through any command line arguments, so any <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>
                    options may also be used with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>. You may also directly edit the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    script by changing the HTTPD variable near the top to specify the correct location of the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>
                    binary and any command-line arguments that you wish to be always present. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing that httpd does when it is invoked is to locate and read the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/configuring.html" target="_blank">configuration file </a>httpd.conf . The location of this file is set at compile-time, but it is possible to specify its location at run time using the -f command-line option as in: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -f /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf </em>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If all goes well during startup, the server will detach from the terminal and the command prompt will return almost immediately. This indicates that the server is up and running. You can then use your browser to connect to the server and view the test page in the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot" target="_blank">DocumentRoot </a>
                    directory and the local copy of the documentation linked from that page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Apache suffers a fatal problem during startup, it will write a message describing the problem either to the console or to the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#errorlog" target="_blank">ErrorLog </a>
                    before exiting. One of the most common error messages is " Unable to bind to Port ... ". This message is usually caused by either: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Trying to start the server on a privileged port when not logged in as the root user; or 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trying to start the server when there is another instance of Apache or some other web server already bound to the same Port. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For further trouble-shooting instructions, consult the Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ </a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    lf you want your server to continue running after a system reboot, you should add a call to <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    to your system startup files (typically rc.local or a file in an rc.N directory). This will start Apache as root. Before doing this ensure that your server is properly configured for security and access restrictions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    script is designed to act like a standard SysV init script; it can take the arguments start , restart , and stop and translate them into the appropriate signals to <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/httpd.html" target="_blank">httpd </a>. So you can often simply link <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/apachectl.html" target="_blank">apachectl </a>
                    into the appropriate init directory. But be sure to check the exact requirements of your system.
