        <h2>Retrieve operation</h2>
        This REST endpoint will allow a client to retrieve all links to services where data and metadata is deployed and thus is accessible.
        This operation is also used to retrieve the status of a store operation that has been successfully committed.
        For a full description of how this operation works, please refer to <a href="../../tasks/retrieve.html">this</a> section
        The retrieve operation is accessible at the URL http://&lt;TOMCAT_IP&gt;:&lt;TOMCAT_PORT&gt;/ArchivingServer/service/retrieve/&lt;ITEMD_ID&gt;<br>
        The HTTP method to use for accessing the operation is GET<br>
        <h3>Input message</h3>
        The only parameter needed by the retrieve operation is the identifier through which data and metadata can be identified. This identifier is provided by the
        &lt;ITEMD_ID&gt; field specified in the endpoint URL.

        <h3>Output message</h3>
        The response message is a complex JSON object which contains all links to data and metadata and a status field.
        Its structure is described in the table below.
