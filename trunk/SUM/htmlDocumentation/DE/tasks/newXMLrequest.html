<p>If you have created a service selecting its interface from the Interface Repository the below page is shown otherwise it is skipped. This page will let you specify the operation for which the test file shall be created. For operation whose interface is in the Interface Repository, the test file is an operation specific template while in all other cases an empty file is created. The figure below shows the step described in case an RFQ operation test file shall be created. </p>
