<h1><span class="content">What is Web Processing Service?</span></h1>
<div class="content"> 
  <div class="justify">The Web Processing Service (WPS) is one of OGC's most recent interoperability standards. A Web Processing Service provides access to calculations or models which operate on spatially referenced data. The data required by the service can be available locally, or delivered across a network using data exchange standards such as. The calculation can be as simple as subtracting one set of spatially referenced numbers from another, or as complicated as a global climate change model.<br>
    This specification is intended to provide a mechanism to identify the spatially-referenced data required by the calculation, initiate the calculation, and manage the output from the calculation so that it can be accessed by the client. <br>
