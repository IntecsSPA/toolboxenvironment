<h1>Buddata ebXML Registry (ebRR)</h1>
<p align="justify">Buddata ebXML Registry/Repository (or ebRR in short) is an open source implementation of the OASIS ebXML Registry and OGC Catalogue Service. Extensions of the OASIS ebXML Registry have been implemented to support geospatial capabilities.</p>
<p align="justify">The initial implementation was funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) in support of the cataloguing activity for the Heterogeneous Mission Accessibility - Interoperability program (HMA-I) via the ESA ERGO project.</p>
<p align="justify">Buddata ebRR put's a strong focus on its geospatial capabilities and the goal of the project is to include all so-called "ebRIM Profiles" or "extension packages" as defined by the OGC Catalogue Service, but also to support any other ebRIM profiles.</p>

<h1>Toolbox catalogue integration</h1>
<p align="justify">The Toolbox has been upgraded in order to natively support new OGC Catalogue Interfaces.  The following ebRIM profiles will be supported by the tool over the OGC CSW 2.0.2 interface:
<ul>
    <li> OGC-06-131r4 - OGC Catalogue Services Specification 2.0 Extension Package for ebRIM (ISO/TS 15000-3) Application Profile</li>
    <li> OGC-07-038   - OGC Cataloguing of ISO Metadata (CIM) Using the ebRIM profile of CS-W</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p align="justify">It is possible to instantiate the new Catalogue Service following two different approaches: gateway and stand-alone.
</p>

<p align="justify">The former allows the user to link an existing catalogue providing the Toolbox Catalogue Service logic in the form of XML scripting. In this case the development approach is similar to developing a Toolbox service.
</p>

<p align="justify">The latter approach allows to deploy Catalogue Service instances without the need of providing any form of logic.</p>

<p align="justify">The Buddata ebXML Registry core has been used to add these functionalities to the Toolbox.
