                <h2>System requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    J2SE Development Kit 5.0 (JDK 5.0) is supported on Microsoft Windows running Intel IA32, 100% compatible processors, and AMD Opteron 32. For supported versions of Windows, along with disk and RAM requirements, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/system-configurations.html">System Configurations</a>. 
                    The minimum physical RAM is required to run graphically based applications. More RAM is recommended for applets running within a browser using the Java Plug-in. Running with less memory may cause disk swapping which has a severe effect on performance. Very large programs may require more RAM for adequate performance. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note -- Trying to install the JDK on a non-supported version of Microsoft Windows or on a machine that doesn't have a sufficiently up-to-date Service Pack will cause the installer to generate this warning: "We recommend that you do not install this Java platform for the following reasons: This Java platform does not support the operating system or operating-system service pack on this machine."
                </p>
