<h1>Security configuration:</h1>
For a given Toolbox service, it is possible to specify if WS-Security
and (optionally) XACML policies need to be enforced during any service
invocation; this information can be set through the Toolbox
administration pages during the service creation or configuration
procedure by using the following HTML page panel:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 806px; height: 98px;" alt="" src="file:///media/disk-1/Progetti/Codice/TOOLBOX_rep/trunk/SUM/htmlDocumentation/RE/images/serviceSecurityConfiguration.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
To edit WS-Security related information just:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Check/uncheck the WS-Security check-box to enable/disable
WS-Security and XACML for the current service; when the field is
checked then the fields on the right are enabled to be edited;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the KeyStore file chooser to provide the physical key-store
archive where the service private key and certificate is stored; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the Alias and Password text fields to set the user name and
password which are needed to retrieve the private key stored in the
provided key-store;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>(Optional) check XACML check-box and use the associated
file-chooser to provide the physical file with the XACML policy;
alternatively uncheck it to remove any previously loaded XACML policy;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Depending on the action currently performed upon the service,
i.e. creation or update, click the Create or the Configure button (not
showed in the figure)</li>
</ul>
After the service configuration has been created or updated than it is
possible to query it by using the View Current Configuration feature of
the Toolbox Client.<br>
<br>
<h1>Note about WS-Security policy:</h1>
For a given service protected via WS-Security, WS-Security policy
information are currently attached by default: the policy is the one
which satisfies the HMA-T requirements about WS-Security. WS-Security
policy for a given protected service are automatically stored in its
WSDL file; so it is possible to use the Toolbox Client to retrieve the
service WSDL file and so the defined WS-Security policy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Note about the Toolbox installation to support WS-Security:</h1>
Toolbox installation for WS-Security requires a dedicated java library
from the Bouncy Castle organization (http://www.bouncycastle.org): this
library provides cryptography extensions to the Java default
installation.<br>
To enable Toolbox WS-Security usage it is necessary to manually
download and copy the bouncy castle jar corresponding to the JDK
currently used for the Toolbox; then it is necessary to add
bouncycastle as a security provider in the Java installation. In
practice:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Download bouncycastle according to your java version. You can download bouncycastle from the following link:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html">http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html</a></li>
  <li>Add the bcprov-jdkXX-XXX.jar to the JRE&#8217;s /lib/ext directory;</li>
  <li>Add the following line to java.security file which can be found in JRE's lib/security directory as the last line:</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">security.provider.X=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider<br>
</div>
where X has to be replaced by the progressive number according to the current security providers already listed.</body></html>
