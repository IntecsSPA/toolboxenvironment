            <h2>The context</h2>
            <p>
                The TOOLBOX has been initially developed under the SSE project and then upgraded within the GENESIS .
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                <a href="http://services.eoportal.org/" target="_blank">SSE</a>
                integrates service providers (having variety of component 
                models or middle-ware suited for their different platforms 
                or environments) through <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml" target="_blank">XML</a>, 
                i.e. using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP" target="_blank">SOAP</a>
                and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl" target="_blank">WSDL</a>
                transported over a variety of transport mechanisms, i.e.
                IP, HTTP, and HTTPS. Thus, any service to be integrated
                within the SSE infrastructure must expose a SOAP interface
                (described by a WSDL file) according to the SSE Interface
                Control Document (<a href="RE/icd.html">SSE ICD</a>). The <a href="overview.html">TOOLBOX</a>
                helps the service provider to convert its service in a SOAP 
                based service compliant with the <a href="RE/icd.html">SSE
                    ICD</a>.

                The <a href="http://www.genesis-fp7.eu/" target="_blank">GENESIS</a>
                FP7 Integrated Project has been launched by DG INFSO in September 2008. The duration of the project is 3 years. 
                The GENESIS consortium comprehends the 33 partners involved in the project ; the Coordinator of the project is Thales Alenia Space France.
                The GENESIS Consortium brings a wide panel of multidisciplinary skills and experiences :
          <ul>
                    <li>
                        participants skilled and experienced in ICT and related domains are key actors to define a reference collaborative architecture, and to make an efficient and sustainable solution;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        participants skilled and experienced in environmental domains as well as in health issues are key actors for the identification of users requirements, definition and implementation of the pilots, evaluation and take-up of the solution.
                    </li>
          </ul>
                Relying on standards and harmonization processes, GENESIS will provide a thematic-independant innovative solution : made of a generic software package. It is used as an "information system set-up framework", which provides the interoperability layer to existing information systems, so that they can access to environmental databases or services available at regional, national or European levels. The proposed solution, highly flexible and scalable, can be easily instantiated and customized to various thematic fields and various contexts all over Europe. The GENESIS framework is based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), where software components are grouped in classes of services; each class providing a particular type of function.

                From the W3C specification:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                SOAP
                is a lightweight protocol for exchanging structured information in a
                decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol
                that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for
                describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of
                encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined
                datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and
                responses.

                The Toolbox is composed by two application, a <a href="DE/main.html">development environment</a>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The run-time environment is a web application which allows the deployment
                    of generic and OGC compliant Web Services by means of some XML
                    scripts which describe the operations that have to be done when the
                    service is invoked
                </li>
                <li>
                    The development environment is an Eclipse plugin which provides some tools
                    to easily creates the TOOLBOX services ,
                    editing its script files and resources and automatic deploy the services
