In this page we report all the patches created for version 9.0.2 of the Toolbox

= Patch 0.1 =

Bugs Fixed:

1. A bug on the HTTP download via the proxy has been found. The proxy configuration settings are ignored by the Toolbox when it tries to download a file from a remote URL. This is due to an update of the HTTP library.

2. A bug on the "Add WPS processing" interface has been found. Some characters of the engine script (loaded from local disk) are replaced by blank character.

A patch to solve these problems has been created and can be downloaded [http://code.google.com/p/toolboxenvironment/downloads/detail?name=TOOLBOX_ProxyPatch.tar.gz&can=2&q= here].
