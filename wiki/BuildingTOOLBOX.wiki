= Building TOOLBOX using the Ant file =

TOOLBOX can be built using an Ant file. The file will take care of downloading all needed resources and compile them.
In order to build TOOLBOX follow the below steps:

  * Open a shell and move to a temporary folder.
  * Execute the command svn export http://toolboxenvironment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BuildScripts/ToolboxRuntimeEnvironmentBuild.xml
  * ant -f ToolboxRuntimeEnvironmentBuild.xml

 As a result the directory will contain two .war files ready for deployment under Tomcat.
