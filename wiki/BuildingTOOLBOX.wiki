= Building TOOLBOX using the Ant file =

TOOLBOX can be built using an Ant file. The file will take care of downloading all needed resources and compile them.
In order to build TOOLBOX follow the below steps:

  * Open a shell and move to a temporary folder.
  * Execute the command svn export http://toolboxenvironment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BuildScripts/ToolboxRuntimeEnvironmentBuild.xml
  * ant -f ToolboxRuntimeEnvironmentBuild.xml

 As a result the directory will contain two .war files ready for deployment under Tomcat.

= Building TOOLBOX using the Netbeans project =

The SVN repository contains the Netbeans project files. In order to import the project into Netbeans you have to:

  * Download the TOOLBOX folder. e.g. svn export http://toolboxenvironment.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/TOOLBOX
  * Open Netbeans
  * Select the "Open project" menu and provide the TOOLBOX folder. This should visualize the TOOLBOX project.
  * Once opened, update the project paths if needed.
