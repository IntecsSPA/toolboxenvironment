= Contributing to TOOLBOX =

If you are a software developer then that is of course the obvious way to help out, to write code to improve TOOLBOX. Generally developers start with bug fixes and small patches, and then move into larger contributions as they learn the system. Even if you don't know Java, or do not really know how to program, we do encourage you to try to look at the code and figure out what is going on. That is the whole beauty of open source, you can open up the hood of the car and see how it is running. You can start as a user and slowly educate yourself on how it all works. Our developers are more than happy to help out as you learn and get acquainted, and we try our hardest to keep our code clean and well documented. For further information about developing with TOOLBOX please refer to these Wiki pages or contact us at toolbox@intecs.it.
